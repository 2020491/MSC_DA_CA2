"I can only imagine how much effort went into making this film. The visuals, sound design, soundtrack, color grading, and story are all absolutely breathtaking!"
I‚Äôm an old man now and I never saw harvesting of cranberries‚Ä¶ your video was absolutely amazing.. You can‚Äôt imagine the respect to have for your people
Phenomenal storytelling! Absolutely outstanding work!
"This is why I have massive respect for farmers, they literally are the reason that everyone else in the world is able to afford their lifestyle. Without the sacrifice that they make humanity would be nothing."
This whole video was so satisfying to watching. The narrating and storytelling and the video itself was so phenomenal. I enjoyed every moment of it
"This was just amazing production quality! This is how all educational videos should look! Kudo's to the production and editing and filming crew! Everything was perfect right down to the music! Even if I wasn't interested in cranberry harvesting, the production quality on this video kept me watching! Just a beautiful job everyone! Perfect."
Deffinetly one of the better videos I've ever watched on youtube!  Insanely well made! Truly deserves more atention/wiews in my opinion!
Beautiful video; really outstanding overview of growing cranberries and the dedication of farming families.
I'm a beekeeper. I didn't expect that part of the video! I love it. Bees play such an important role.
"Very well made video, thank you! Incredible irrigation system. If I may, I have a few questions..."
How long do they last in cold storage for?
How often do you replant the beds? 
How much water do they use while they growing?
I just can't stop adoring the filming and the effort 
"My god this is beautiful , Better than National Geographic , Better than anyone out there! "
Loads of love and best wishes to the production team
"This is an amazing video with the beautiful touch of documentary. I love cranberries.  This is my first time to get a whole picture of the story behind these charming ‚Äúfairies‚Äù. After watching it, I can help from writing my comment to show my deepest respect for you and your team and your great work, shills and perseverance and wisdom of planting and running this cranberry fairyland!  You are blessed with one of the best plants in the nature."

That was awesome!  Thanks for all you do.  I love the way you showed each step of the process.
"Amazing work, I appreciate these farmers and many alike!"
"From start to finish, that was the most fascinating mini-documentary film I've ever watched. I was curious about cranberries (sitting here and eating my mother-in-law's homemade cranberry bread) and I watched three other videos on cranberries before this one but was only left with more unanswered questions! This video truly explained the whole process and it showed EVERYTHING, from start to finish. I'm seriously impressed, both with cranberry farmers AND the quality of this video. Thanks!"
Thank you for doing this video.  We are a homeschool family who like to learn about different farming practices. This was very informative about something we were not familiar with.
This was fascinating. I've always wondered how they grew.
I'm crying when they started harvesting.. So amazing 
Awesome production quality and great storytelling. The agriculture industry would benefit greatly from producers like you. Good work. Subscribed!
I could not believe the number of subs and views you have in these videos. Amazing storytelling and great visuals too. This channel has to grow huge.

"Awesome production, I love large scale family run agricultural businesses. I'm a commercial beekeeper out of the great state of Idaho, loved the shout out to the pollinators. American farmers keeping America great."
"Dang you cover a lot of important topics in the video production space! We love what you do, don't stop. Anytime you are in Arizona reach out. If you'd like, message us @dmakproductions on IG and we can chat. You kill it!"
"This is honestly really good.. The video is amazing, great story.. we can see the passion in their eyes. Looking forward to more videos like this..."
I retired in 2010. Went to work on a marsh seasonally in 2011. Been there ever since. Old age tells me to stop but I love it too much. Great video.
"Great scenery, everyday images, close to back, strangely unique under the camera angle. Thank you!"
Wonderfully documented! Answered all the questions I've had about the process!! Wisconsin proud!
it's beautiful. the most beautiful and logic detailed farming video i've ever seen. hats of to the director and everybody envolved...
"I live 30 miles from this cranberry farm and have personally seen it. Luke, you captured the beauty, on camera, as it is in real life. Thank-You."
"Incredible!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR LIFE, KNOWLEDGE AND PASSION with all of us. Love this video"
Thank you for this in depth year round story of a cranberry. My kids really enjoyed learning the journey. Off to the store to buy some cranberries!
What a great job with the narration and video quality.  It is something I would expect to see on PBS. Better than what cable is producing. Why cant Discovery or NatGeo produce this?
I'm from rapids and the cranberry fields are plenty. Love the cranberry fest when I go back to town for vacation in the summer. Thank you for a great video.
I loved learning more about farming cranberries- I have such an appreciation for farmers
Beautiful. These are the kind of people you grow old with because you don't get stressed being with them all day the seasons will pass quickly.
This is the best harvest video I‚Äôve ever seen 
"Wow. Didn't know how cranberry is grown, harvested and processed.  Now  I understand why the juice is expensive...hard work, passion, commitment and skill for the fruit.  Great informative video. Thanks from Kenyaüá∞üá™"
This guy Luke Parmeter needs to start making this quality of show for streaming services. If Netflix had a whole series with this quality of production I would be hooked
"Amazing little berries. I knew a little about the process, growing up in Vermont, but never realized the extent of the whole process."
little different process than the corn and soybeans in South Dakota. Video was awesome too! Very well put together. Thank you for sharing!
I have always wondered how cranberries were grown and harvested. Great video! Keep up the good work.
"This is inspiring. You guys have a great life, amazing video work too!"
"Amazing, maximum respect for outstanding job your doing."

This was phenomenally shot and edited‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt really care for the growing process but I stayed for the editing..
So interesting I never knew how cranberries are grown and harvested. Interesting video.
This is so well done!  We love how you told their story.
"Very interesting. I never knew anything about growing and harvesting cranberries. By the way, I love cranberries!"
"Great documentary, thanks for the hard work and education."
You all including cranberries and those bees  are awesome Ô∏è
How interesting! Beautiful cinematography! Thanks for making this. I really enjoyed it!
Every year I use several bags of your product. Thank you for sharing your beautiful berries. For my holiday table. Stay well and remember....I appreciate your time and energy to make it ready for me to enjoy. Every year!
I appreciate you and everyones hard work.
"There was a big channel that had a video on cranberry farms, also one that supplies ocean spray, recently that hit a lot of people‚Äôs recommended. That‚Äôs how I got here, after watching that video. This is way more in depth though, with great cinematography. Nice work!"
Excellent video. Very well done and informative.
Wow isn't amazing what you find out here! Great film!!! As I grew up in the east in Middleborough MA! With ocean spray and I grew up with a small 13 acre bog! This brings back very found memories! Although we dry picked and you do wet! The rest is the same!! Thanks for trying to show the world what proud farmers you are! Cranberry farming is a very honorable way of life! And think of it! When I was a kid! There wasn't a big  market for berries! Today oh my goodness! You can't get enough!  Yes we had a small screen house but mostly we screened and out in the old wooden boxes! Shipped to the plant! Again thank you for what you are doing! And God bless!!!
.
"Great video! I knew Ocean Spray has a MAZZIVE processing plant in Washington state, but wasn't aware they had plants on the eastern coast."
This is Amazing thank you for sharing this with us
-hughes8172
Absolutely fantastic video! Beautifully done and very interesting 
Looks like they take great care in making the cranberries
"Love it- love the farmers, love the lifestyle, love the job the videographers did.   Really nice.       As a fisherman, and not a critical smart-ass, because i really admire this and will now buy more cranberries-  "
Who in the world would dislike this?  Great documentary!
"Wow! Great documentary! The cinematography was terrific. You have a new subscriber, keep grinding!!!"
"I love me some cranberry juice, sauce, and fruit! Thank you for all your hard work so we can enjoy the fruits of your labors..."
Fantastic Video!  Thanks for putting this together.
"After such a huge efforts and tremendous hard work by all those farmers, We are finally able to enjoy our meal!. And some people even throw their meal when they aren‚Äôt satisfied, coz throwing your meal is a matter of few seconds!., So appreciate what you‚Äôve and appreciate all those farmers!..."
"Respect to farmers,  universities, truck drivers,  scientists and bees , wow how all these come in the super markets."
"Great film ,very educational ,very good story telling  ! Thank you  and be safe"
Since I only buy Ocean Spray I guess there's a good chance I've eaten these folks berries. They are delicious!!

"I usually don't like videos on youtube but had to give this one a like because of the high quality of this video, keep it up"
Thank for all the effort and hard work.

That was amazing. I just watched where my cranberries come from! Wow!

I don't wear red but I loved this video so calming and I love research.
This is fascinating.  Thanks.
"This was informational interesting as well as relaxing... They have ocean spray as a buyer... Nothing else needs to be said, although I promise I didn't think cranberries grew in cold ass Wisconsin like that, always thought of down south cause of the climate. This was some cool shit lol"

Great story for my 3 little homeschool grandkids! Thanks
Fantastic! That is a lot of cranberry nut bread!
I had no idea! I grew up in SE MN and never knew that just acrossed the river was the cranberry capital!
"Just out of curiosity,  wouldn't it be beneficial for you to get some of your own hives? It would be another source of income if you sold the honey."
How many acres do you have? Just for the Cranberries. If you said I am sorry I never caught it. The video is amazing. I really like your operation. I truly like the great staff members. Ty so much for sharing.

"Hi, just happened on you channel and decided to watch the video. Very interesting and informative!"
15 min video about cranberries?!? wtf...I could've watched at least an hour more that shit was cinematic! 
How long does it take to do one area.
That is so cool.  Wisconsin is an awesome.  Hello from your neighbor just to your south in Chicago.  Great job in showing this.
Fascinating 
Amazing 
Now I know why cranberries are expensive. But so good....
Great video 
"What a amazing mannn, love this farmers"
"When I was a kid I never wanted anything to do with farming .. I yearned for the glimmer of ‚Äòoffice life‚Äô‚Ä¶.now as an adult in corporate America , I look at these people and wish I had their lifestyle‚Ä¶the irony "
"Give this man more subs, pls!"
wow.... great video Luke. thanks
"And here i am,from another side of the world,who used to think cranberry grow from seeds.Ô∏è"
"Eat ""Crasins"" everyday.  Just had some watching this video, with almonds, walnuts, and some chocolate chips mixed together.  Yummm."
"At .75 inches of sand, one acre (43,560 sq ft) will take100.83 cubic yards of sand.  A square mile (640 acres) will take 64,533 cubic yards of sand"
"Assuming 18 cubic yard trucks. That's 3585 loads of sand per sq mile, or 5.6 loads pre acre.  Wow - not cheap!"

We drink ocean spray cranberry juice drink here in the philippines 
"So, y'all freeze the plants under a layer of ice in the winter? That doesn't hurt them at all? That's incredible. What's the reason you do that, vs just letting them be open to the air in the winter?"
Awesome Video! 
"The video was done nicely, i don't know how 15 minutes passed."
Amazing Cranberry juice is amazing.
I'd pay cash money to visit the rock pile from sorting the sand out!
-gz7kc9xj3h
i have a new appreciation for Cranberries
Awesome!
Made in the USA Awesomeness enjoyed the VIDEO great farm
I grew up in Massachusetts. We used to go out to the bogs every fall and watch the harvests.
Great video!
Can you sell retail or are you exclusive to Ocean Spray?  Have always dreamed of having a 50 gallon barrel in my root cellar.  BIG fan.
Excellent upload. Full watched and have a wonderful day.
This has Moneyball feels bro. Love it
Beautiful
Great video!   Thanks
"Good video, but how do you/they (Buyer) dry cranberries to make craisins."
"Really interesting, thanks."
"Interesting and inspiring story,"
"Ok so he was fertilizing and the plants were very close to the ground, but it didn't look like they were sitting in water. Then when they had the picking machines there were almost no plants, but a lot of water. Does anyone know, is that just the plant part dying back, did they cut it and was that same amount of water there the whole time? Just trying to understand more from someone whose seen it or done it...that's the part I've always wondered about. Thanks in advance."
Awesome video top notch
awesome storyline!!!!
Very nice video. Thanks alot
"If you love and care nature, nature will provide you abundantly."
We all have to thanks all farms because without them we wouldn't have a civilizations
Wishing someday I visit this farm cranberries and try picking country. Travel
I feel like i just watched a wonderful dramatic movie.
"They are not called BEDS....they are called Cranberry BOGS...Look it up.  They started growing them in Wareham and Middleboro Ma.  As a kid, 55 years ago I used to pick cranberries on the BOGS.  Just Sayin."
Its impossible to start farming these days. Starting costs go into tens of millions and nobody with that kind of money wants to drive around in a tractor. Soon family farms will cease to exist and international corporations will control all our food.
"I had no idea about cranberry production, incredible process, thank you."
grt video perfectly filmed
Very good video and interesting.
Great video
Thank you for the cranberries.
Just how many acres are in production verses how many are waiting to grow up to be ready?
Very cool.
Thank you farmers!

Some of you have been asking what this was filmed on‚Ä¶here are a few links:
Camera 
Wide Angle Lens 
Mid Range Lens 
"I can only imagine how much effort went into making this film. The visuals, sound design, soundtrack, color grading, and story are all absolutely breathtaking!"
I‚Äôm an old man now and I never saw harvesting of cranberries‚Ä¶ your video was absolutely amazing.. You can‚Äôt imagine the respect to have for your people
Phenomenal storytelling! Absolutely outstanding work!
"This is why I have massive respect for farmers, they literally are the reason that everyone else in the world is able to afford their lifestyle. Without the sacrifice that they make humanity would be nothing."
This whole video was so satisfying to watching. The narrating and storytelling and the video itself was so phenomenal. I enjoyed every moment of it
"This was just amazing production quality! This is how all educational videos should look! Kudo's to the production and editing and filming crew! Everything was perfect right down to the music! Even if I wasn't interested in cranberry harvesting, the production quality on this video kept me watching! Just a beautiful job everyone! Perfect."
Deffinetly one of the better videos I've ever watched on youtube!  Insanely well made! Truly deserves more atention/wiews in my opinion!
Beautiful video; really outstanding overview of growing cranberries and the dedication of farming families.
I'm a beekeeper. I didn't expect that part of the video! I love it. Bees play such an important role.
"Very well made video, thank you! Incredible irrigation system. If I may, I have a few questions..."
How long do they last in cold storage for?
How often do you replant the beds? 
How much water do they use while they growing?
I just can't stop adoring the filming and the effort 
"My god this is beautiful , Better than National Geographic , Better than anyone out there! "
Loads of love and best wishes to the production team
"This is an amazing video with the beautiful touch of documentary. I love cranberries.  This is my first time to get a whole picture of the story behind these charming ‚Äúfairies‚Äù. After watching it, I can help from writing my comment to show my deepest respect for you and your team and your great work, shills and perseverance and wisdom of planting and running this cranberry fairyland!  You are blessed with one of the best plants in the nature."
That was awesome!  Thanks for all you do.  I love the way you showed each step of the process.
"Amazing work, I appreciate these farmers and many alike!"
"From start to finish, that was the most fascinating mini-documentary film I've ever watched. I was curious about cranberries (sitting here and eating my mother-in-law's homemade cranberry bread) and I watched three other videos on cranberries before this one but was only left with more unanswered questions! This video truly explained the whole process and it showed EVERYTHING, from start to finish. I'm seriously impressed, both with cranberry farmers AND the quality of this video. Thanks!"
Thank you for doing this video.  We are a homeschool family who like to learn about different farming practices. This was very informative about something we were not familiar with.
This was fascinating. I've always wondered how they grew.
I'm crying when they started harvesting.. So amazing 
Awesome production quality and great storytelling. The agriculture industry would benefit greatly from producers like you. Good work. Subscribed!
I could not believe the number of subs and views you have in these videos. Amazing storytelling and great visuals too. This channel has to grow huge.
"Awesome production, I love large scale family run agricultural businesses. I'm a commercial beekeeper out of the great state of Idaho, loved the shout out to the pollinators. American farmers keeping America great."
"Dang you cover a lot of important topics in the video production space! We love what you do, don't stop. Anytime you are in Arizona reach out. If you'd like, message us @dmakproductions on IG and we can chat. You kill it!"
"This is honestly really good.. The video is amazing, great story.. we can see the passion in their eyes. Looking forward to more videos like this..."
I retired in 2010. Went to work on a marsh seasonally in 2011. Been there ever since. Old age tells me to stop but I love it too much. Great video.
"Great scenery, everyday images, close to back, strangely unique under the camera angle. Thank you!"
Wonderfully documented! Answered all the questions I've had about the process!! Wisconsin proud!
it's beautiful. the most beautiful and logic detailed farming video i've ever seen. hats of to the director and everybody envolved...
"I live 30 miles from this cranberry farm and have personally seen it. Luke, you captured the beauty, on camera, as it is in real life. Thank-You."
"Incredible!!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR LIFE, KNOWLEDGE AND PASSION with all of us. Love this video"
Thank you for this in depth year round story of a cranberry. My kids really enjoyed learning the journey. Off to the store to buy some cranberries!
What a great job with the narration and video quality.  It is something I would expect to see on PBS. Better than what cable is producing. Why cant Discovery or NatGeo produce this?
I'm from rapids and the cranberry fields are plenty. Love the cranberry fest when I go back to town for vacation in the summer. Thank you for a great video.
I loved learning more about farming cranberries- I have such an appreciation for farmers
Beautiful. These are the kind of people you grow old with because you don't get stressed being with them all day the seasons will pass quickly.
This is the best harvest video I‚Äôve ever seen 
"Wow. Didn't know how cranberry is grown, harvested and processed.  Now  I understand why the juice is expensive...hard work, passion, commitment and skill for the fruit.  Great informative video. Thanks from Kenyaüá∞üá™"
This guy Luke Parmeter needs to start making this quality of show for streaming services. If Netflix had a whole series with this quality of production I would be hooked
"Amazing little berries. I knew a little about the process, growing up in Vermont, but never realized the extent of the whole process."
little different process than the corn and soybeans in South Dakota. Video was awesome too! Very well put together. Thank you for sharing!
I have always wondered how cranberries were grown and harvested. Great video! Keep up the good work.
"This is inspiring. You guys have a great life, amazing video work too!"
"Amazing, maximum respect for outstanding job your doing."
This was phenomenally shot and edited‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt really care for the growing process but I stayed for the editing..
So interesting I never knew how cranberries are grown and harvested. Interesting video.
This is so well done!  We love how you told their story.
"Very interesting. I never knew anything about growing and harvesting cranberries. By the way, I love cranberries!"
"Great documentary, thanks for the hard work and education."
You all including cranberries and those bees  are awesome Ô∏è
How interesting! Beautiful cinematography! Thanks for making this. I really enjoyed it!
Every year I use several bags of your product. Thank you for sharing your beautiful berries. For my holiday table. Stay well and remember....I appreciate your time and energy to make it ready for me to enjoy. Every year!
I appreciate you and everyones hard work.
"There was a big channel that had a video on cranberry farms, also one that supplies ocean spray, recently that hit a lot of people‚Äôs recommended. That‚Äôs how I got here, after watching that video. This is way more in depth though, with great cinematography. Nice work!"
Excellent video. Very well done and informative.
Wow isn't amazing what you find out here! Great film!!! As I grew up in the east in Middleborough MA! With ocean spray and I grew up with a small 13 acre bog! This brings back very found memories! Although we dry picked and you do wet! The rest is the same!! Thanks for trying to show the world what proud farmers you are! Cranberry farming is a very honorable way of life! And think of it! When I was a kid! There wasn't a big  market for berries! Today oh my goodness! You can't get enough!  Yes we had a small screen house but mostly we screened and out in the old wooden boxes! Shipped to the plant! Again thank you for what you are doing! And God bless!!!
"Great video! I knew Ocean Spray has a MAZZIVE processing plant in Washington state, but wasn't aware they had plants on the eastern coast."
This is Amazing thank you for sharing this with us
Absolutely fantastic video! Beautifully done and very interesting 
Looks like they take great care in making the cranberries
"Love it- love the farmers, love the lifestyle, love the job the videographers did.   Really nice.       As a fisherman, and not a critical smart-ass, because i really admire this and will now buy more cranberries-  "
Who in the world would dislike this?  Great documentary!
"Wow! Great documentary! The cinematography was terrific. You have a new subscriber, keep grinding!!!"
"I love me some cranberry juice, sauce, and fruit! Thank you for all your hard work so we can enjoy the fruits of your labors..."
Fantastic Video!  Thanks for putting this together.
"After such a huge efforts and tremendous hard work by all those farmers, We are finally able to enjoy our meal!. And some people even throw their meal when they aren‚Äôt satisfied, coz throwing your meal is a matter of few seconds!., So appreciate what you‚Äôve and appreciate all those farmers!..."
"Respect to farmers,  universities, truck drivers,  scientists and bees , wow how all these come in the super markets."
"Great film ,very educational ,very good story telling  ! Thank you  and be safe"
Since I only buy Ocean Spray I guess there's a good chance I've eaten these folks berries. They are delicious!!
Such a beautiful and informative video!
"Great work, thanks for this great production."
Amazing! 
This is like something from a fairy tale your grandmother told you
"Very informative. Thanks for taking the time to let us know about ""The Berry""."
Beautiful documentary. Well done.
Wow! watching this is like watching a Movie!! Love every detail of it! VERY GREAT!!!
WOW!!! What an awesome film. NatGeo and Discovery Channel quality for sure!!! You‚Äôre very talented!
I cant belive I just watched it from start to finish without checking my phone once. Amazing video!
"Amazing, thank you for sharing. I learned a lot"
1k subs? What?? I had to read that 5 times to make sure I read it right. You deserve more. Most of these shots are incredible.
Good stuff.  Always wondered how the process worked
Very good story.  Thanks for telling us how it is done
"Great story. Well shot, well told."
Really really well made!
That looks like an incredible place to live and work
What a great example why our bees are so damn IMPORTANT!great lil video!learned alot!
Very well done.  Thanks for making this video and sharing the lives of these fine Americans.
"I usually don't like videos on youtube but had to give this one a like because of the high quality of this video, keep it up"
Thank for all the effort and hard work. 
such a nice work.  My question is if these berries can get any disease when growing  ??
That was amazing. I just watched where my cranberries come from! Wow!
OMG..I didn't realize how much when into cranberries!!..I will Soo much appreciate my cranberries more..be safe & blessedÔ∏è
Super cool video.  I drink a lot of Ocean Spray juice and it's cool to see where it starts.
Wow!  That‚Äôs full time hard work!  Impressive!
I don't wear red but I loved this video so calming and I love research.
This is fascinating.  Thanks.
"This was informational interesting as well as relaxing... They have ocean spray as a buyer... Nothing else needs to be said, although I promise I didn't think cranberries grew in cold ass Wisconsin like that, always thought of down south cause of the climate. This was some cool shit lol"
I Love to watch this video...hope to see for real how the cranberry is being  harvest...
Simply Amazing loved it thank you for the vid. stay safe and have an awesome day.
Amazing and lots of work!

Fantastic! That is a lot of cranberry nut bread!
I had no idea! I grew up in SE MN and never knew that just acrossed the river was the cranberry capital!
"Just out of curiosity,  wouldn't it be beneficial for you to get some of your own hives? It would be another source of income if you sold the honey."
How many acres do you have? Just for the Cranberries. If you said I am sorry I never caught it. The video is amazing. I really like your operation. I truly like the great staff members. Ty so much for sharing.
I loved seeing all that red. The video had so many pretty shots.
"Some hardworking people doing what they love, and the product is the proof."
Thank you for the great video Luke.

Just plain old good work Brother.     Thanks for a peek thru the keyhole.          Philadelphia
"Hi, just happened on you channel and decided to watch the video. Very interesting and informative!"
15 min video about cranberries?!? wtf...I could've watched at least an hour more that shit was cinematic! 
How long does it take to do one area.
That is so cool.  Wisconsin is an awesome.  Hello from your neighbor just to your south in Chicago.  Great job in showing this.
Fascinating 
Amazing 
Now I know why cranberries are expensive. But so good....
Great video 
"What a amazing mannn, love this farmers"
"When I was a kid I never wanted anything to do with farming .. I yearned for the glimmer of ‚Äòoffice life‚Äô‚Ä¶.now as an adult in corporate America , I look at these people and wish I had their lifestyle‚Ä¶the irony "
"Give this man more subs, pls!"
wow.... great video Luke. thanks
"And here i am,from another side of the world,who used to think cranberry grow from seeds.Ô∏è"
"Eat ""Crasins"" everyday.  Just had some watching this video, with almonds, walnuts, and some chocolate chips mixed together.  Yummm."
"At .75 inches of sand, one acre (43,560 sq ft) will take100.83 cubic yards of sand.  A square mile (640 acres) will take 64,533 cubic yards of sand"
"Assuming 18 cubic yard trucks. That's 3585 loads of sand per sq mile, or 5.6 loads pre acre.  Wow - not cheap!"
We drink ocean spray cranberry juice drink here in the philippines 
"So, y'all freeze the plants under a layer of ice in the winter? That doesn't hurt them at all? That's incredible. What's the reason you do that, vs just letting them be open to the air in the winter?"
Awesome Video! 
"The video was done nicely, i don't know how 15 minutes passed."
Amazing Cranberry juice is amazing.
I'd pay cash money to visit the rock pile from sorting the sand out!
i have a new appreciation for Cranberries
Awesome!
Made in the USA Awesomeness enjoyed the VIDEO great farm
I grew up in Massachusetts. We used to go out to the bogs every fall and watch the harvests.
Great video!
Can you sell retail or are you exclusive to Ocean Spray?  Have always dreamed of having a 50 gallon barrel in my root cellar.  BIG fan.
Excellent upload. Full watched and have a wonderful day.
This has Moneyball feels bro. Love it
Beautiful
Great video!   Thanks
"Good video, but how do you/they (Buyer) dry cranberries to make craisins."
"Really interesting, thanks."
"Interesting and inspiring story,"
"Ok so he was fertilizing and the plants were very close to the ground, but it didn't look like they were sitting in water. Then when they had the picking machines there were almost no plants, but a lot of water. Does anyone know, is that just the plant part dying back, did they cut it and was that same amount of water there the whole time? Just trying to understand more from someone whose seen it or done it...that's the part I've always wondered about. Thanks in advance."
Awesome video top notch
awesome storyline!!!!
Very nice video. Thanks alot
"If you love and care nature, nature will provide you abundantly."
We all have to thanks all farms because without them we wouldn't have a civilizations
Wishing someday I visit this farm cranberries and try picking country. Travel
I feel like i just watched a wonderful dramatic movie.
"They are not called BEDS....they are called Cranberry BOGS...Look it up.  They started growing them in Wareham and Middleboro Ma.  As a kid, 55 years ago I used to pick cranberries on the BOGS.  Just Sayin."
Its impossible to start farming these days. Starting costs go into tens of millions and nobody with that kind of money wants to drive around in a tractor. Soon family farms will cease to exist and international corporations will control all our food.
"I had no idea about cranberry production, incredible process, thank you."
grt video perfectly filmed
Very good video and interesting.
Great video
Thank you for the cranberries.
Just how many acres are in production verses how many are waiting to grow up to be ready?
